      <h3>STEPS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350ºF and spray a 10 x 7-inch casserole dish with
          cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a knife to chop your sourdough into bite-sized pieces around 1 to
          1.5-inches wide. If your sourdough is fresh from the bakery, it might
          be easier to tear the pieces apart with your hands. Transfer bread
          into casserole dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, sprinkle on 1 cup of chopped pecans and toss with sourdough
          pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl whisk together eggs, Greek yogurt, maple syrup,
          cinnamon, nutmeg, milk, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour egg mixture on top of sourdough and use your hands to press the
          bread into the egg mixture, submerging it. You want to make sure you
          do this to fully coat all pieces of bread.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place in refrigerator overnight OR for at least 30 minutes if you'd
          like to bake it immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make streusel topping by mixing together white whole wheat flour,
          chopped pecans, brown sugar, and butter. Combine to form a crumble,
          not a paste. This will depend on how soft your butter is, so make sure
          not to fully melt it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove French toast bake from the refrigerator and use your hands to
          submerge the bread in the egg mixture one more time before baking.
          Cover with tin foil and bake at 350ºF for 30 minutes, covered. Remove
          and add streusel topping. Bake for another 15-25 minutes, uncovered
          depending on how wet you like your French toast.
        </li>
        <li>Let cool for at least 5-10 minutes before slicing.</li>
      </ol>
